Technical Details
The website is built using HTML and CSS. It features a responsive design for both phones and laptops and includes a toggle bar (hamburger menu) for navigation on smaller screens. JavaScript is used to control the carousel on the main page.

Challenges Faced
Making the Page Responsive: Adapting the website to display correctly on both phone and laptop screens was a challenge.

Designing the Toggle Bar: Creating an effective toggle bar for the navigation menu on smaller screens was challenging.
