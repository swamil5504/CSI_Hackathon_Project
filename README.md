The CSI_Hackathon_Project is a website repository called GreenImpact. It was created as part of the CSI Hackathon project to promote environmental awareness and showcase the efforts of the organization.

The website includes information about GreenImpact's mission, initiatives, achievements, and how to get involved.

Keep in mind the website is for a fictional NGO.

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1)Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/swamil5504/CSI_Hackathon_Project.git.

2)Open the project directory in your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

3)Install the "Live Server" extension for Visual Studio Code or use your preferred method to serve HTML files.

4)Launch the website by opening index.html with a live server.

**Technical Details:**

The website is built using HTML and CSS.

It features a responsive design for both phones and laptops and includes a toggle bar (hamburger menu) for navigation on smaller screens.

JavaScript is used to control the carousel on the main page.

**Challenges Faced:**

The project faced challenges in making the page responsive and designing an effective toggle bar for the navigation menu on smaller screens.

**Solutions:**

To overcome these challenges, custom CSS and media queries were used to ensure responsiveness on different screen sizes.

JavaScript was employed to create a toggle bar that efficiently handles navigation on smaller screens.

**Acknowledgments:**

The project was developed as part of the CSI Hackathon. I would like to thank the event organizers for their collaboration and hard work.

Feel free to explore the website,I have launched this website on github-pages. 

Do check that out!

I also have uploaded the official presentation in the files, which can be referred to for precise implementation and understanding of the website.

Cheers!
