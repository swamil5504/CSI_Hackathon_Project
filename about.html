        <p><u><b>Our Story</b></u></p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Warning signs, especially in the last decade, like the heat waves, the rapid rate of ozone depletion, the bushfires, the earthquakes, droughts and tsunamis were enough stimulus for us to start working in order to secure our environment and minimise the unforeseen horrors.<br>

                GreenImpact was founded by Swamil Randive.<br>

                We started our endeavor by organising plantation drives where we carry out tree plantations, tend to them, and undertake the necessary steps for their maintenance.<br>
                
                After the overwhelming success of our plantation drives, we took it upon ourselves to organize cleanliness drives. These drives focus on a particular area with saturated waste and is cleaned by the vigilant group members with proper equipment and sanitation.<br>
                
                When the pandemic of COVID-19 hit us all, binding us to our homes, plantation and cleanliness drives were out of bounds, we refused to stop.<br>
                
                We came up with 3 different initiatives to keep up our good work.<br>
                
                We started making newspaper bags, cloth bags out of old waste T-shirts and newspaper envelopes for safe disposal of sanitary products.<br>
                
                GreenImpact works in 4 major areas in Pune namely Kothrud, Sahakar Nagar, Hadapsar and Pimpri-Chinchwad.<br>
                
                Each area is considered as a Zone for planning environment initiatives. Initially, GreenImpact began working in the Kothrud area and hence it was the first zone established by Swamil Randive.<br>
